title: Hackspace @ National Day of Civic Hacking, 2016
---

# Welcome!
Welcome to the hackspace for Albuqeurque's National Day of Civic Hacking Event. We only have a few hours, so please speed-read this page, decide what you want to work on, and dive right in. We highly recommend partnering with at least one other person. If your project involves tech you're not familiar with, you might try pair-programming with a partner on a single computer. If you need help deciding where to start or with anything else, ask Brad!

## What should I work on?
We've proposed a variety of different projects below, to appeal to different skill and experience levels. 

1. [Bring an existing app to ABQ](#port)
2. [Blaze your own trail](#blaze)
3. [Putter around on something easy](#putter)
4. [Specifically for Designers](#design)

#### Fork "Austin Park Equity" and adapt it to Albuquerque
*"Austin Park Equity is an open-source project that aims to increase equitable park access. Our maps help visualize how Austin's park resources are distributed throughout the City of Austin."*

* Note that this is an ambitious mapping project, beyond the scope of what you can accomplish on National Day.

### 2. Blaze your own trail
#### Tackle a National Challenge
Code for America and various government agencies have issued 19 [challenges for local groups](https://www.codeforamerica.org/events/national-day-2016) to take on today. Many of them are too large to tackle in our small half-day event, but if you're up for a big challenge and one of them catches your eye, go for it!
