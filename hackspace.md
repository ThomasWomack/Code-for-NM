title: Hackspace @ National Day of Civic Hacking, 2016

# Welcome!
Welcome to the hackspace for Albuqeurque's National Day of Civic Hacking Event. We only have a few hours, so please skim the ideas below, decide what you want to work on, and dive right in. We highly recommend partnering with at least one other person. If your project involves tech you're not familiar with, you might try pair-programming with a partner on a single computer. If you need help deciding where to start or with anything else, ask for Brad!

## Things you can work on

### Add Albuquerque to "Click that hood" neighborhood naming game.
* [The site](http://click-that-hood.com/)
* [Instructions](https://github.com/codeforamerica/click_that_hood/wiki/How-to-add-a-city-to-Click-That-%E2%80%99Hood)
* [Data](https://www.cabq.gov/gis/geographic-information-systems-data)

### Fork "Austin Park Equity" and adapt it to Albuquerque
*"Austin Park Equity is an open-source project that aims to increase equitable park access. Our maps help visualize how Austin's park resources are distributed throughout the City of Austin."*

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/open-austin/austin-park-equity)
* Note that this is an ambitious mapping project, beyond the scope of what you can accomplish on National Day.
