# Welcome!
Welcome to the hackspace for Albuqeurque's National Day of Civic Hacking Event. We only have a few hours, so please speed-read this page, decide what you want to work on, and dive right in. We highly recommend partnering with at least one other person. If your project involves tech you're not familiar with, you might try pair-programming with a partner on a single computer. If you need help deciding where to start or with anything else, ask Brad!

## What should I work on?
We've proposed a variety of different projects below, to appeal to different skill and experience level. So what do you want to do?

* [I want to bring another city's civic app to ABQ](#port)
* [I want to blaze my own trail](#blaze)
* [I just want to putter around and learn while contributing something small](#putter)
* [I'm a designer](#design)

## Bring an existing app to ABQ

1. Add Albuquerque to "Click that hood" neighborhood naming game.
  * [The site](http://click-that-hood.com/)
  * [Instructions](https://github.com/codeforamerica/click_that_hood/wiki/How-to-add-a-city-to-Click-That-%E2%80%99Hood)
  * [Data](https://www.cabq.gov/gis/geographic-information-systems-data)

2. Fork "Austin Park Equity" and adapt it to Albuquerque
  * *"Austin Park Equity is an open-source project that aims to increase equitable park access. Our maps help visualize how Austin's park resources are distributed throughout the City of Austin."*
  * [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/open-austin/austin-park-equity)
  * Note that this is an ambitious mapping project, beyond the scope of what you can accomplish on National Day.

## Blaze your own trail

1. **Tackle a National Challenge**. Code for America and various government agencies have issued 19 [challenges for local groups](https://www.codeforamerica.org/events/national-day-2016) to take on today. Many of them are too large to tackle in our small half-day event, but if you're up for a big challenge and one of them catches your eye, go for it!
2. **Make a Twitter bot**. Find an interesting piece of data that is updated regularly (maybe something from CABQ's [data portal](https://www.cabq.gov/abq-data/)) and create a Twitter bot to publish it. Our [Cute Pets bot](https://github.com/codeforabq/CutePets) takes about 90 minutes to deploy and may be a good starting point for your bot.

## Putter around on something smaller

1. [**Civic Tech Issue Finder**](http://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/civicissues) Help out on other projects in other cities.
2. [**Service Census**](https://service-census.herokuapp.com/). Help audit the digital services available at CABQ.gov by entering data on the Service Census. Even though the research project that motivated the site has concluded, it's still a valuable tool for benchmarking Albuqeurque's digital services against other cities.
3. [**Open Data Census**](http://us-city.census.okfn.org/)
4. [**Maproulette**](http://maproulette.org) Contribute edits to OpenStreetMap, an open source & open data alternative to Google Maps and the backbone of many of the best web mapping applications.
5. [**Ecuador Earthquake crisis mapping**](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/2016_Ecuador_earthquake) - Seven weeks ago a magnitude 7.8 earthquake killed hundreds of Ecuadorians and devastated Ecuadors infrastructure. After crises like this, the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) mobilizes to improve and update maps in the affected region, to aid emergency responders, relief workers, and eventually reconstruction. The mapping response to the Ecuador quake is still underway and you can contribute. Note that there is a bit of a learning curve to contributing to HOT, so you may end up spending today exclusively learning, but if so you'll be ready to contribute immediately the next time HOT is mobilized.

## For designers.

1. **Open Budget ABQ** - Code for ABQ has been working on an open budget application, and we could benefit from a design treatment. Ask Brad for help getting started on this.
2. **National Challenges** - Some of the [National Challenges](https://www.codeforamerica.org/events/national-day-2016) mentioned above are as much about data visualization as technology. The EPA's waste visualization challenge, for example. Take a look and see if any of those challenges speak to you.
3. **Local Infographics** - Tell the story behind [a city dataset](https://www.cabq.gov/abq-data/) by creating an infographic.
