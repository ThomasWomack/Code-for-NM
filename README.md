# codeforabq.github.io
This _will soon be_ the source for codeforabq.org. We're migrating it from hosted Wordpress to GitHub+Jekyll, so we can host for free and so people can contribute more easily.

## Overview
This site is run directly from the _master_ branch of this GitHub repository, with static pages generated by Jekyll. You don't need to run Jekyll locally on your machine to contribute content to the site, but you will need it to work on the design.

## Running Jekyll locally
### Prereqs:
Ruby. That's it.

### Setup
1. Run `gem install jekyll` to install it
2. Clone this repository and `cd` to its root directory
3. Run `jekyll serve` and browse to http://127.0.0.1:4000 or http://localhost:4000 . Note that you must run `jekyll serve` from the site's root directory. As long as you leave that jekyll server running, you can make edits to the source and the static pages will be regenerated on the fly.
