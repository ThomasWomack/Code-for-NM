title: Get Ready for Our September Meetup
author: Noel

For September's Meetup, we will work together to create an online learning site for new software developers. Learning Management Systems are useful for a variety of situations, and with Wordpress and several plugins we can shorten the time it takes to deploy our very own courses, reference materials, and educational materials. 

The instructions below will walk you through the set up process so that we can hit the ground running, and all start on the same page, on the day of the meetup. If you have any trouble or questions, please use GitHub to submit an issue or message us on the Code4Abq Slack channel.
