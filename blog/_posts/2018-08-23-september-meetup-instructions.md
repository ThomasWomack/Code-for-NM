### _At September's Meetup, we will work together to build an online learning site for new software developers!_

Learning Management Systems are useful for a variety of purposes, and with Wordpress and several plugins we can shorten the time it takes to deploy our very own courses, reference materials, and educational materials. 

The instructions below will walk you through the set up process so that we can hit the ground running (and all start on the same page) when we meet on September 25th. Please complete the steps in order to fully participate. If you have any trouble or questions, please use [GitHub to submit an issue](https://github.com/codeforabq/Code-for-NM), message us on the Code4Abq Slack channel, or send an email to [noelcothren@gmail.com](mailto:noelcothren@gmail.com). 

_The site we create will use the following plugins:_
- [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/)
- [Sensei](https://woocommerce.com/products/sensei/)
- Duplicator 
- Storefront Theme

## Get Ready!
1. Download and install [Local by Flywheel](https://local.getflywheel.com/)
2. Make a [new Wordpress install](https://wordpress.org/download/)
3. Go to file directory and copy over files, run installer

**On the night of the meetup, we will work in up to 3 teams to complete the following tasks for our Learning Site:**
1. Create a new course to teach our learners a skill
2. Build a directory of people and institutions to know in the NM Tech Scene
3. Build a glossary of terms new developers must learn
