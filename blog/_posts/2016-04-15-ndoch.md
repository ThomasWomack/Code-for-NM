I'm pleased to announce that, on June 4th, 2016, *Code for Albuquerque* will be hosting an event for the *National Day of Civic Hacking*.

> together to host civic tech events leveraging their skills to help their
> community. (Source: [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/events/national-day-2016))

National Day of Civic Hacking officially began in 2012. Albuquerque participated in 2013, with the [ABQ Civic Tech Day](https://nmtechcouncil.org/2013/05/abqcivictech/) organized by the New Mexico Tech Council, the City of Albuquerque, and numerous other partners. In 2015, our newly formed Code for Albuquerque brigade joined with AIGA NM in support of their [Createathon](https://newmexico.aiga.org/event/createathon/), a 24 hour marathon providing creative and technical services to area non-profits.

Our 2016 Albuquerque event is still taking shape, but [registration is open](http://bit.ly/abqhackday2016). Activities will include the following:
  - The *first ever [MaptimeABQ](http://maptime.io/albuquerque)*. Maptime is a beginner-friendly meetup for anyone who loves making maps or wants to learn to do so.
  - A *codefest* for experienced and beginner developers and designers. We'll choose several small projects that may benefit Albuquerque citizens and launch them in a single day.
  - A *civic tech showcase* featuring local civic tech organizations and tools.
  - A *community input workshop*, hosted by ImagineABQ, where citizens can share their ideas about the tech tools they think would most benefit Albuquerque citizens.
  - A *screening area* where participants can watch short films about civic tech, open data, and more.
